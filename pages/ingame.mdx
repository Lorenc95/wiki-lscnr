# 📋 Rules

By playing on our server, you automatically agree to the rules. Please keep in mind that common sense and respectful ethical behavior are expected from all members. These rules are not comprehensive and use of loopholes to violate the spirit of these rules is subject to enforcement.

These rules cover your behavior in and around our server, as well as your username and character name. This server is also streamer friendly, so your behavior has to follow the Twitch / Kick Community Guidelines. In addition to these server-specific rules, the Cfx.re Platform Service Agreement applies when using FiveM.

## Rule Interpretation & Fair Play [26/02/2026]

Rules cannot cover every possible situation. Any action that clearly violates the spirit of fair competition, intended gameplay, or server integrity may result in punishment — even if not explicitly written.

Attempting to exploit loopholes, wording technicalities, or mechanics in bad faith will not be accepted.

Staff retain final authority in interpreting these rules.

## General Conduct

Any sort of spamming, advertising, sexual harassment, discrimination and hate speech (racism, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia, ableism, etc.) is not allowed.

You are also not allowed to threaten or dox others, wish death or serious illnesses upon someone, or host in-depth discussions about illegal real-world topics like crimes and controlled substances (unless these relate to in-game functions).

We encourage everyone to be respectful, civil, and ethical. Playful banter is allowed, but excessive hostility, targeted harassment, or repeated escalation may result in punishment.

### Excessive Toxicity / Provocation [26/02/2026]

Competitive banter is allowed. However, excessive trash talk, repeated provocation, baiting, targeted harassment, or attempts to escalate conflict may result in moderation action.

Toxicity intended to trigger retaliation does not justify breaking other rules.

Furthermore, we only allow English in Text & Voice chat.

---

## Cheating and Exploits

Using third-party hardware, software or tools, as well as exploiting unintentional mechanics, glitches or bugs to gain an unfair advantage over other players is not allowed. This includes using VPNs to cause lag/latency and lag switching.

### Exploit Definition [26/02/2026]

An exploit includes but is not limited to:

• Abusing unintended mechanics  
• Using revive/spawn states to secure unfair kills  
• Triggering system behavior that prevents opponents from responding  
• Repeating a known unfair mechanic after being told to stop  

Claiming something is “part of the game” does not make it allowed if it clearly removes fair counterplay.

---

### Spawn & Revive Protection [26/02/2026]

Players must be given a fair opportunity to regain control after spawning or being revived.

Intentionally killing players while they:
• Are on a black revive screen  
• Are visually loading in  
• Cannot move or respond  
• Have not regained UI control  

Will be treated as exploiting unintended mechanics.

---

### Star Baiting

You are not allowed to intentionally get other players a wanted level in an unfair way.

### Clothing

Invisible or texture-manipulated clothing that hides body parts is prohibited.

### Emotes

No emoting during fights or chases.

### Ghost Peeking

Bullets passing through walls via cover abuse is not allowed.

---

### Safe Zones [26/02/2026]

Designated safe zones (such as hospitals, spawn areas, or other marked locations) are no-combat areas.

• No killing  
• No baiting  
• No provoking  
• No camping to farm players  

Violations may result in punishment.

---

### Finding and Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, you may not abuse it. Gather evidence and report it. Repeated abuse of known bugs may result in escalated punishment.

---

## Combat Logging

Disconnecting intentionally during combat or to avoid arrest is prohibited.

Intentionally killing yourself to avoid consequences is also combat logging.

### Reconnect Requirement [26/02/2026]

If disconnected unintentionally during combat, you must reconnect within 5 minutes. Failure to return may be treated as combat logging.

### Exceptions

Combat logging is allowed in specific listed scenarios (as already defined above).

---

## Meta Gaming & Stream Sniping [26/02/2026]

Using external communication tools (Discord, live streams, calls, etc.) to gain in-game advantage against players not present in that channel is prohibited.

Stream sniping — using someone’s livestream to locate or gain advantage over them in-game — is strictly forbidden.

---

## Third-Party Interference [26/02/2026]

Do not involve yourself in active fights unless:

• You are directly engaged  
• You are part of the situation  
• You have a valid rule-based reason  

Randomly joining ongoing fights is prohibited.

---

## Team Rules

(Your full existing Team Rules remain unchanged below this line.)

---

## Staff Authority & Discretion [26/02/2026]

Staff retain the authority to interpret and enforce rules based on context and intent.

• Publicly disputing finalized staff decisions may result in further action  
• Repeated bad-faith arguments may escalate punishment  
• We reserve the right to remove staff status or apply server punishments at our discretion  

Staff decisions are final unless reviewed internally by management.

---

## Staff Representation Clause [26/02/2026]

Staff members represent the server at all times, on duty or off duty.

Publicly downtalking the server, staff team, or encouraging toxicity undermines community trust and may result in staff removal or further disciplinary action.
